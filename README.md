# teleborg
A loose Telegram bot API for Rust based on the traiting system.

How to use the project
======================
Add this to your `Cargo.toml`
``` toml
[dependencies]
teleborg = { git = "https://github.com/voider1/teleborg" }
```
I will add this project to crates.io in the future when I've developed it some more.
Note that this project only works on Rust 1.16 or above, which is currently in the nightly phase.

A simple example
================
This example shows you how Teleborg works in its simplest form. It's not yet very full fledged, but it can respond to commands.

```Rust
extern crate teleborg;
use teleborg::command_handler;
use teleborg::bot::Bot;
use teleborg::objects::update::Update;
use teleborg::updater;

fn main() {
    let mut commands = command_handler::CommandHandler::new();
    let bot_token = "bot_token".to_string();
    commands.add("test", test);
    updater::Updater::start(Some(bot_token), None, None, None, commands);
}

fn test(bot: &Bot, update: Update) {
    bot.reply_to_message(&update, "It works!").unwrap();
}
```

Currently I only support send_message, reply_to_message and forward_message. More is to come.
If you don't want to put your token in your code, just pass None for your bot token and export your token as an environment variable with the name TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN. The library takes the environment variable out on its own.
